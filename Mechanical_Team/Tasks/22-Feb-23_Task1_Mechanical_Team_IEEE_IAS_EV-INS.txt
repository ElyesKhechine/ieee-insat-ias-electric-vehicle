Watch these tutorials:
01 ==> 33: note on a small notebook the main tips
96 ==> 111: learn more about the efficiency of the 3D sketching and the weldments, for now, just do a 3D sketch only using lines, don't use the "Structural member" function
Recommended steps:
1) Watch all the tutorials that are mentioned above, then create the side profile of the ladder frame on the "Right Plane" (use 3D sketching)
You can copy the design from an existing chassis of one of these trucks:

2) Use real dimensions: Length: about 1800-2000 mm
3) To know more about the suspension choice that you wanna go for, as well as about some chassis congigurations, check these files:

VDHS-10 
SSP 77
BASE 04
You find them in the: Mechanical team ==> Documents and ressources ==> Learning the basics

4) ctrl+s / ctrl+z are soooo useful

5) Once you finish the sketch on the right plane, create a plane parallel to it (on the "Geometry Reference" menu), the distance between the planes should be 450mm

6) Move your 3D sketch above the new plane on the list on the left (Tutorial 32)

7) Use the "Mirror entities" to create the other side of the vehicle: the mirror will be the plane that you created ==> width of the vehicle will be 900mm

8) Start linking the sides to create a chassis that looks like one of those trucks (Chosen above)

If you want to take a look at an existing 3D chassis made with tubes, check this folder:

You can download and modify it to experiment what you have learnt.
