Watch these tutorials:
01 ==> 33: note on a small notebook the main tips
96 ==> 111: learn more about the efficiency of the 3D sketching and the weldments, for now, just do a 3D sketch only using lines, don't use the "Structural member" function
Recommended steps:
1) watch all the tutorials that are mentioned above, then create the side profile of the car on the "Right Plane" (use 3D sketching)
2) use real dimensions and always check the overall dimensions: height and length
3) you can check the conformity of the dimensions in comparison to the cars that are competitors (Folder named "Dimensions" found on the Drive Folder: Mechanical )
4) ctrl+s / ctrl+z are soooo useful
5) once you finish the sketch on the right plane, create a plane parallel to it (on the "Geometry Reference" menu), the distance between the planes should be 950mm
6) move your 3D sketch above the new plane on the list on the left (Tutorial 32)
7) use the "Mirror entities" to create the other side of the vehicle: the mirror will be the plane that you created ==> width of the vehicle will be 1900mm
8) start linking the edges and imagine the stress points so all the links shouldn't be horizontal
